#Becoming a Udacity Code Reviewer
##S.P.E.C.S.

###Simplify Code:
How can this code be simplified somehow?


Examples:

* [Muddy and oversized classes, liar functions and commented out code](http://joostdevblog.blogspot.ie/2015/01/what-most-young-programmers-need-to.html)

* [Functions that are too long](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/475675/when-is-a-function-too-long)


###Practice Kindness:
It is always important to remember that the review is being provided to a student who has invested several hours of their lives into the project we are reviewing.
	Resources:

[Stack Overflow Model](http://stackoverflow.com/help/be-nice)

In short: **Be Nice:**

* Rudeness and belittling language are not okay.
* Be welcoming, be patient, and assume good intentions.
* Don't be a jerk.

Example:
[Highlighting Awesome Code Snippets](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-gr001/l-3562098906/m-3647758553)


###Explain Why and with Examples:
Explain why using online references and creating code snippets with [Github's Gist Tool](https://gist.github.com/). Gist is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others.

Resources (mostly on semicolons):

* [Google's JavaScript Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml#Semicolons)

* [When to use Semicolons in JavaScript](http://www.choskim.me/when-to-use-semicolons-in-javascript/)

* [Jacques uses a popular internet meme to help the learner remember this concept.](http://davidwalsh.name/demo/javascript-semicolons.png)


###Connect Learners:
A good Code Reviewer connects the student to a source of knowledge they did not previously have.

Examples:

1. Tech Talks
2. Code libraries like PyPi & Cocoa Pods
3. Twitter and Meetup groups

###Style Consistently
It does not matter what style guide the student uses as long as they're consistent with the styles they use throughout their code.
