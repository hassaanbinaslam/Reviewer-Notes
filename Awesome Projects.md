- Classic Arcade, 4862, Comment from a reviewer - code provided for review is the best one I ever seen in this kind of assignment. It is demonstrating student made great effort to understand JavaScript specifics. If there could be any negative comment - for this particular assignment provided solution is classical example of "over engineering", but as an programming exercise it is still great.
- Movie Trailer Website, 7941, Comment - Code provided for review is really great in this category. It shows that the student made very good effort in learning object oriented programming, and a solid understanding of the material. Also, code is very well documented, follows style guidelines well, and is very readable.
